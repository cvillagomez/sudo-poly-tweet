"b'Washington is failing the American people, but I will continue to fight for a better path, one that respects the will of the American people, who sent us here to fight for fiscal sanity.'",2
b'These provisions are the few glimmers of light trying to escape the gravity of this black-hole of federal spending and liberal priorities.',2
"b'Second, the bill includes the Taylor Force Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored, which will stop U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to the Palestinian Authority if it continues its policy of paying monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.'",2
b'The bill will also increase our security here at home by providing resources for new border security infrastructure and personnel.',2
"b'First, it fully funds our military, providing an additional $61 billion for national defense over FY 2017 levels, the largest year-to-year increase in base funding for the Department of Defense in 15 years.'",2
"b'Finally, although this bill overall is truly a monstrosity, it does contain a few positive elements for which I gladly advocated.'",2
"b'I also worked to prevent an increase in the passenger facility charge; another tax increase that would have driven up the cost of every airline ticket purchased by consumers and inflicted a significant burden on the Texas airline industry, which supports thousands of Texas jobs.'",2
"b'This proposal would have applied to virtually every transaction on the Internet, pouring cold water on the benefits of the bold tax cuts we achieved last year. Americans need more permanent tax relief, not additional tax burdens.'",2
"b'Lobbyists in Washington also almost got a new Internet sales tax added to the bill, which would have been catastrophically foolish.'",2
"b""I'm proud we successfully blocked a bailout of Obamacare. There were voices in DC who wanted to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars directly to insurers, so they can maintain their Obamacare policies. We promised Americans we would repeal and replace Obamacare, not prop it up.""",2
"b'To be sure, this bill could have been even worse. I am happy to say that I was able to fight to keep out even more egregious proposals.'",2
"b'All of these measures amount to piling even greater debt onto the backs of our kids and grandkids, all because we are incapable of living within our means.'",2
"b'It fails to reduce funding for the EPA, which under Obama administration zealots, killed thousands of jobs and dramatically strayed from its core mission of ensuring clean air and water.'",2
"b'It funds the Ex-Im Bank, a classic example of corporate welfare that has doled out over $100 billion in taxpayer-guaranteed loans, primarily to a handful of giant and well-connected corporations.'",2
"b'It tells federal agencies that they can spend taxpayer dollars to study the \xe2\x80\x98causes\xe2\x80\x99 of gun violence, a mandate that \xe2\x80\x93 make no mistake \xe2\x80\x93 will be abused by future liberal administrations to manufacture evidence to try to violate law-abiding citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Second Amendment rights.'",2
"b'It fails to provide sufficient funds to properly secure our border, let alone build the wall that is necessary.'",2
"b""It continues to fund sanctuary cities, which are defying law &amp; making Americans less safe. Instead of rewarding sanctuary cities, we should be passing legislation like Kate\xe2\x80\x99s Law, a bill I introduced to put criminal illegal aliens in jail so they can't prey on innocent Americans.""",2
"b'It continues to fund Planned Parenthood, a corrupt organization whose horrifying abortion practices should preclude it from receiving taxpayer dollars.'",2
b'The disastrous elements of this bill are almost too numerous to list.',2
"b'Now, Congress is poised to do the exact opposite: pass a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill \xe2\x80\x94 2200 pages drafted by the Swamp in the dark of night \xe2\x80\x94 that will plunge our nation even deeper into debt.'",2
"b'In 2016, the American people voted overwhelmingly for Republicans to change Washington.'",2
b'This is why I\xe2\x80\x99ll vote against the omnibus spending bill:',2
b'I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to confront and defeat the tyrannical Iranian regime and help ease human suffering in this tumultuous region.',2
"b'Because our servicemen and women are not themselves engaged in armed conflict in Yemen, but rather are providing refueling and logistical support for the efforts of our allies, the constitutional requirement for a declaration of war is not triggered.'",2
b'I also remain a strong defender of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority to declare war prior to extended military conflict.',2
"b'The supporters of the Resolution have raised some reasonable concerns, and I believe Congress should continue to exercise appropriate oversight over the Executive Branch.'",2
"b'Absent US leadership, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen would undoubtedly worsen; oversight related to laws of armed conflict would be an afterthought; and our men and women in uniform could potentially be required to engage in a conflict far more dangerous than exists today.'",2
"b'Strategic implications of US retreat from established agreements &amp; obligations w/ allies not only damages counterterrorism efforts w/ partners, but serves to create a vacuum for other actors, such as Russia, to assert unchecked influence &amp; provide material support, w/o conditions'",2
"b'Yemen, a country plagued with conflict, is fertile ground for exploitation by the Iranian regime to advance their political and military ambitions.'",2
b'Iran and their terror network continue to spread hate and radical ideologies across the Middle East. This deeply destabilizing force must be confronted at every opportunity either directly or through our partners and allies.',2
